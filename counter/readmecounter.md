This React project is a basic counter application that demonstrates the usage of React, functional components, and the useState hook. The application consists of a simple user interface that displays a counter value along with two buttons to increment and decrement the counter.

<h4>Key Concepts and Technologies Used:</h4>
<h5>React:</h5>
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components and efficiently update the UI when the application state changes.

<h5>Functional Components:</h5>
In this project, the main component (App) is a functional component. Functional components are a simpler way to define components using JavaScript functions.

<h5>useState Hook:</h5>
The useState hook is a React hook used for adding state to functional components. It allows components to have state variables and update them, triggering re-renders when the state changes.

<h4>Functionalities:</h4>
<h5>Counter Display:</h5>
The application displays the current value of the counter using the counter state variable.

<h5>Increment and Decrement Buttons:</h5>
Two buttons, "Add value" and "Remove value," are provided to increment and decrement the counter, respectively.

<h5>useState Hook Usage:</h5>
The useState hook is used to manage the state of the counter variable. The setCounter function is used to update the counter state in response to button clicks.

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
This basic counter project showcases the fundamental concepts of React, including functional components, state management using the useState hook, and inline styling. It serves as a starting point for understanding how React components and hooks can be used to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

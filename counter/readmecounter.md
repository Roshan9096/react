This React project is a basic counter application that demonstrates the usage of React,<br>
functional components, and the useState hook. The application consists of a simple user <br>
interface that displays a counter value along with two buttons to increment and decrement the counter.
Key Concepts and Technologies Used:

React:
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components<br>
and efficiently update the UI when the application state changes.

Functional Components:
In this project, the main component (App) is a functional component. Functional components are a simpler<br>
way to define components using JavaScript functions.

useState Hook:
The useState hook is a React hook used for adding state to functional components. It allows components<br> to have state variables and update them, triggering re-renders when the state changes.

Functionalities:

Counter Display:
The application displays the current value of the counter using the counter state variable.

Increment and Decrement Buttons:
Two buttons, "Add value" and "Remove value," are provided to increment and decrement the counter, respectively.

useState Hook Usage:
The useState hook is used to manage the state of the counter variable. The setCounter function is used to update the counter state in response to button clicks.

Conclusion:
This basic counter project showcases the fundamental concepts of React, including functional components, state management using the useState hook, and inline styling. It serves as a starting point for understanding how React components and hooks can be used to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
